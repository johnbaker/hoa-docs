## ARTICLE IX. Committees
Generally, the Board of Directors may appoint committees as deemed appropriate in carrying out its purpose, pursuant to the provisions of the Declaration, to which these Bylaws are attached as Exhibit "C". Specifically, the Board of Directors may appoint an Architectural Control Committee ("ACC") to consist of at least three (3) and no more than five (5) members, all of whom shall be appointed by the Board of Directors. The ACC, if established, shall have exclusive jurisdiction over all new construction on any portion of the Properties, as well as modifications, additions, or alterations made on or to existing Units or structures containing Units and the open space, if any, appurtenant thereto.

The ACC shall promulgate detailed standards and procedures governing its areas of responsibility and practice, consistent with the guidelines and procedures detailed in this Declaration. In addition thereto, the following shall apply: plans and specifications showing the nature, kind, shape, color, size, materials, and location of such modifications, additions or alterations, shall be submitted to the ACC for approval as to quality of workmanship and design and as to harmony of external design with existing structures, location in relation to surrounding structures, topography, and finish grade elevation.

In the event that the ACC fails to approve or to disapprove such plans or to request additional information reasonably required within forty-five (45) days after submission, the plans shall be deemed approved. Any alterations to approved exterior finishes and elevations must be approved in writing by the ACC.

The approval of the ACC of any proposals or plans and specifications or drawings for any work done or proposed, or in connection with any other matter requiring the approval and consent of the ACC, shall not be deemed to constitute a waiver of any right to withhold approval or consent as to any similar proposals, plans and specifications, drawings, or matters whatsoever subsequently or additionally submitted for approval or consent.

The ACC may authorize variances from compliance with any of the provisions of its guidelines and procedures when circumstances such as topography, natural obstructions, hardship, aesthetic, or environmental considerations require, but only in accordance with duly adopted rules and regulations. Such variances may only be granted, however, when unique circumstances dictate and no variance shall:

- **(a)** be effective unless in writing,
- **(b)** be contrary to the restrictions set forth in the body of the Declaration, or
- **(c)** estop the Committee from denying a variance in other circumstances.

For purposes of this Section, the inability to obtain approval of any governmental agency, the issuance of any permit, or the terms of any financing shall not be considered a hardship warranting a variance.

## ARTICLE X. Books and Records
The books, records and papers of the Association shall at all times, during reasonable business hours, be subject to inspection by any Member. The Declaration, the Articles of Incorporation, and the Bylaws of the Association shall be available for inspection by any Member at the principal office of the Association, where copies may be purchased at reasonable cost.

## ARTICLE XI. Assessments
The Declaration provides for the obligation of Members to pay to the Association annual assessments, special assessments and remedial assessments, all of which are secured by a continuing lien upon the property against which the assessment is made. Any assessments which are not paid in full within thirty (30) days after the due date are in default and shall bear interest as provided in the Declaration. The Association may bring an action for collection as provided for in the Declaration, and any costs associated therewith shall be added to the amount of the assessment and interest. There may be no waiver of assessments provided for herein by non-use of the Common Area or abandonment of a Lot or Unit by an Owner.

## ARTICLE XII. Annual Budget and Report

### SECTION 1. Annual Budget.
The estimated annual Budget (the "Budget") for each fiscal year shall be approved by the Board, and copies thereof furnished to any Member upon written request, not later than thirty (30) days prior to the beginning of such year. The Budget shall provide for the schedule of proportionate shares (monthly, quarterly, etc.) of payment of annual assessments by Members. Although such proportionate share shall be in accordance with the respective ownership in the Common Area and Common Elements, the Board may determine different allocations with respect to parts of such charges whenever the Board determines, in its sole discretion, that said allocation may be unfair. Allocations shall be applied uniformly to all Members of like situations and shall be final and binding upon all parties. In the event that the Board shall not approve an annual budget or fail to determine the assessments for any year, or shall be delayed in doing so, each Member shall continue to pay the amount of their respective assessments as last determined until such time as they are notified of the new budget/assessments by the Board.

### SECTION 2. Partial Year or Month.
For the first fiscal year, the annual budget shall be approved by the First Board. If such first fiscal year, or any succeeding fiscal year shall be less than a full year, then the assessments for each Member shall be proportionate to the number of months and days covered by said Budget. Commencing with the date of occupancy of its Unit, each Member shall pay assessments for the following period or fraction of a period, which assessment shall be in proportion to ownership interest in the Common Area or Common Elements and the number of months and days covered by the current Budget, and which assessment shall be computed by the Board.

### SECTION 3. Annual Report.
Within forty-five (45) days after the end of each fiscal year covered by the Budget, or as soon thereafter as shall be practicable, the Board shall cause to be made available to any Member requesting same in writing, a statement for such year so ended, showing the receipts and expenditures and such other information as the Board may deem desirable.

### SECTION 4. Supplemental Budget.
In the event that during the course of any year, it shall appear to the Board that the monthly assessments, determined in accordance with the Budget for such year, are insufficient or inadequate to cover the expenses of the Association for the remainder of the year, then the Board shall prepare and approve a supplemental budget covering the estimated deficiency, copies of which supplemental budget shall be made available to each Member upon written request, and assess a special assessment to each Member for its proportionate share.

### SECTION 5. Expenditures.
Except for expenditures and contracts specifically authorized by the Declaration and Bylaws herein, the Board shall not approve any expenditures in excess of Five Thousand and No/100 Dollars ($5,000.00) unless required for emergency repair, protection or operation of the Common Area or Common Elements, or enter into any contract for more than three (3) years without approval by a majority of the Members. For purposes of this paragraph, the discharge of a mechanic's lien which, in the opinion of the Board, constitutes a lien against the Common Area or Common Elements, shall be deemed to be an expenditure required for the emergency repair, protection or operation of the Common Area or Common Elements.

## ARTICLE XIII. Indemnification of Board of Directors, Officers and Committee Members
The Association shall indemnify and hold each of its directors and officers, each member of any committee appointed pursuant to the Bylaws of the Association, and the Board, against all contractual and other liabilities to others arising out of contracts made by or other acts of such directors, Board, officers or committee members, on behalf of the Members or arising out of their status as directors, Board, officers, or committee members, unless any such contract or act shall have been made in clear violation of the Declaration or these Bylaws, or fraudulently or with gross negligence or criminal intent. This indemnification shall include indemnification against all costs and expenses (including, but not limited to, counsel fees, amounts of judgments paid and amounts paid in settlement) reasonably incurred in connection with the defense of any claim, action, suit or other proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or other, in which any such director, officer, Board or committee member may be involved by virtue of such person being or having been such director, officer, Board or committee member.

Provided, however, that such indemnity shall not be operative with respect to:

- **(a)** any matter as to which such person is finally adjudged to be liable for gross negligence or fraud in the performance of their duties as such director, officer, Board or committee member; or  
- **(b)** any matter settled or compromised, unless, in the opinion of independent counsel selected by or in a manner determined by the Board, there is not reasonable grounds for such persons being adjudged liable for criminal acts, or clearly violating the Declaration or these Bylaws, or for gross negligence or fraud in the performance of their duties as such director, officer, Board or committee member.

Expenses incurred in defending a civil or criminal action, suit or proceeding may be paid by the Association in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding as authorized by the Board of Directors in the specific case, upon receipt of an undertaking satisfactory to the Board by or on behalf of the person or entity seeking such indemnification or payment in advance to repay such amount unless it shall ultimately be determined that such person is entitled to be indemnified by the Association as authorized by this Article.

The Association and the Board shall have the power to raise and the responsibility for raising any sums required to discharge its obligation under this Article by special assessment. The indemnification provided by this Article shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification may be entitled under any statute, agreement, vote of Members of the Association or otherwise. In no event, however, shall this indemnity exceed coverage occasioned by liability insurance coverage, which the Association is required to carry and maintain.

## ARTICLE XIV. Amendments
These Bylaws shall be amended in the same manner as the Declaration, to which these Bylaws are attached as Exhibit "C", pursuant to Article IX thereof.

## ARTICLE XV. Miscellaneous

### SECTION 1. Fiscal Year.
The fiscal year of the Association shall begin on the first day of January and end on the 31st day of December of every year, except that the first fiscal year shall begin on the date of incorporation.

### SECTION 2. Rules of Order.
Except as may be otherwise provided herein, the parliamentary conduct of all meetings of the Board and of the Association shall be conducted substantially in accordance with the most recent edition of Roberts Rules of Order.

### SECTION 3. Severability.
Invalidation of any covenant, condition, restriction, provision, sentence, clause, phrase or word contained in these Bylaws, or the application thereof in any circumstances, shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions thereof or the application thereof, which shall remain in full force and effect.

### SECTION 4. Gender and Grammar.
The singular wherever used herein shall be construed to mean the plural when applicable, and the necessary grammatical changes required to make the provisions hereof apply either to corporations or individuals, male or female, shall in all cases be assumed as though in each case fully expressed.

### SECTION 5. Notices.
Any notice required to be sent to the Owner of any Lot pursuant to any provision of the Declaration or these Bylaws shall be served by personal delivery or by depositing such notice in the mails, postage prepaid, regular mail, addressed to an Owner at such address as such Owner may have designated to the Association, or if no other address has been designated then at the address of such Owner's Lot. Such service shall be deemed sufficient, and the date of service shall be the date of mailing.

The transaction of any meeting of the Board of Directors, however called and noticed or wherever held, shall be as valid as though taken at a meeting duly held after regular call and notice if:

- **(a)** a quorum is present, and  
- **(b)** either before or after the meeting each of the directors not present signs a written waiver of notice, a consent to the holding of the meeting, or an approval of the minutes.

The waiver need not specify the purpose of the meeting. Notice of a meeting shall also be deemed given to any director who attends the meeting without protesting before or at its commencement about the lack of adequate notice.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, we, being all of the directors of WINSTON HILLS HOMEOWNER'S ASSOCIATION, INC., have hereunto set our hands this 3th day of January 2005.
